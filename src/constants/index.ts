    title: 'Scaling E-Commerce to 10K RPS with GraphQL Federation',
    excerpt: 'How I decomposed a monolithic storefront into federated subgraphs, implemented distributed caching, and achieved sub-100ms P99 latency at scale.',
    date: '10.2025',
    content: `When ShopXIndia outgrew its monolithic REST API, I led the migration to a federated GraphQL architecture using Apollo Federation v2. The system was decomposed into five domain-aligned subgraphs — catalog, inventory, orders, users, and payments — each independently deployable and owned by separate teams.\n\nThe critical challenge was query performance. A single storefront page could resolve data across three subgraphs. I implemented a multi-tier caching strategy: Redis for entity-level caching with 30s TTL, DataLoader for request-scoped batching to eliminate N+1 queries, and Cloudflare edge caching for anonymous catalog requests.\n\nAuthentication was handled via a custom gateway plugin that validates JWTs at the router level and propagates user context to subgraphs through headers, avoiding redundant token verification. For observability, I instrumented every resolver with OpenTelemetry spans, feeding into Grafana dashboards that track per-subgraph latency, error rates, and cache hit ratios.\n\nThe result: P99 latency dropped from 1.2s to 87ms, the system comfortably handles 10K requests per second during flash sales, and deployment frequency increased from weekly to multiple times per day per service.`,

    title: 'Building Real-Time Infrastructure: WebSockets at Scale',
    excerpt: 'Architecture decisions behind a real-time messaging system supporting 50K concurrent connections with presence, typing indicators, and WebRTC signaling.',
    date: '04.2025',
    content: `SocialPedia required real-time capabilities that went far beyond basic chat — presence tracking, typing indicators, read receipts, live notifications, and peer-to-peer video calling via WebRTC signaling.\n\nI architected the real-time layer using a horizontally scaled WebSocket cluster backed by Redis Pub/Sub for cross-instance message fanout. Each Socket.IO server instance maintains local connection state, while Redis handles room-level broadcasting. This allows us to add WebSocket nodes behind a load balancer without sticky sessions — connections are stateless at the infrastructure level.\n\nFor presence, I implemented a heartbeat-based system where clients send a ping every 15 seconds. Absence of two consecutive pings triggers an offline event propagated to all friends via Redis. Typing indicators use a debounced emit pattern — the client sends a "typing" event, and the server auto-expires it after 3 seconds if no follow-up arrives.\n\nWebRTC signaling was the most complex piece. I built a custom signaling server that handles offer/answer exchange and ICE candidate trickling through the existing WebSocket channel, eliminating the need for a separate signaling infrastructure. TURN server fallback is configured for users behind symmetric NATs.\n\nAt peak, the system sustains 50K concurrent WebSocket connections across 4 nodes with a median message delivery latency of 12ms.`,

    title: 'Zero-Trust File Sharing: End-to-End Encryption in the Browser',
    excerpt: 'Implementing client-side AES-256-GCM encryption, pre-signed S3 URLs, and ephemeral access links for a file sharing platform with zero server-side trust.',
    date: '03.2025',
    content: `FileShareX was designed around a zero-trust principle: the server should never have access to plaintext file contents. Every file is encrypted client-side using the Web Crypto API with AES-256-GCM before upload.\n\nThe encryption flow works as follows: the browser generates a random 256-bit key and a 96-bit IV per file. The file is encrypted in streaming chunks (64KB buffers) to handle large files without memory pressure. The encrypted blob is uploaded directly to S3 via a pre-signed PUT URL — the server never touches the file bytes. The decryption key is embedded in the URL fragment (after the #), which browsers never send to servers.\n\nFor sharing, I implemented three mechanisms: direct links with the key fragment, QR codes encoding the full URL, and email-based sharing where the recipient gets a link that prompts for a PIN (the PIN derives the decryption key via PBKDF2 with 100K iterations). Ephemeral links auto-expire after a configurable TTL or download count using S3 object lifecycle policies and a Lambda function that revokes pre-signed URLs.\n\nThe architecture uses pre-signed URLs for both upload and download, meaning S3 bandwidth costs are the only storage expense — no application-layer proxy needed. File metadata (name, size, expiry, share method) is stored in MongoDB, but never the encryption key.`,
